A Clojure library designed to calculate pi by various methods.

[![Current build status](https://travis-ci.org/rillian/clj-pi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rillian/clj-pi)

## Usage

Right now there's only one method. Call
```clojure
(mc-pi 1.0e6)
```
to estimate the value of pi with monte-carlo sampling.
The single argument is the number of samples to take.
